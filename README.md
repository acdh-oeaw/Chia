ChIA – Accessing and Analysing Cultural Images with New Technologies, is a collaborative effort between the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities, the Adapt Centre at Dublin City University (DCU) in Ireland and Europeana Local – Austria. The project aims to engage and test new technologies against the background of a selected dataset of food images for the benefit of accessing and analysing cultural data.
